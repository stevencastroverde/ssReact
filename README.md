This repo is for Stream Search React. Stream Search was the first app that I built. I thought the idea of being able to search multiple video sources at once was an app that I personally needed. As I learned more about web development, I saw there was a lot of room for improvement from my first iteration. I started recreating the app in Angular 2, but I didn't think it was the best tool for the job, so I decided to give it a go in React.
